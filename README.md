## Reason For Project

This project was inspired by the `React front to back` course by brad traversy on udemy.
This is a rebuild of his house marketplace project in my favourite tech stack.
I wanted to use this project to learn Next js.
**Note there are a few improvements to his original Project**

### Why didn't i use the App router?

> For some reason whenever i develop with the app router it takes alot of `RAM` which makes DX very poor.
> so for now until i get a new system all my Next js projects will be in the page router.
> When i do get a new system , i will migrate my code to the  App router.
